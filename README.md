# About
This plugin allows you to create nicely textured 2D polys.
Simply place a few points then create / assign the shape material and you should have a good looking polygon.

The textures used are similar to what you would use if making terrain using TileMaps/TileSets

## Support
- Supported and Tested on Godot 3.2
- Should work with later versions of Godot 3.x
